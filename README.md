## Code utilities

- [fromWebSerial](https://rxjs-ninja.tane.dev/modules/utility.html#fromwebserial) - RxJS Ninja utility function that returns the serial read data as an Observable, and can also receive an Observable to use as a write stream.
- [SimpleWebSerial](https://fmgrafikdesign.gitbook.io/simplewebserial/) - Easy-to-use library that allows web enthusiasts to easily connect an Arduino with their web project. Employs an event-driven coding style.

## Documentation / Implementation / Tutorials

- [MDN Official Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API) - includes a deep dive into the API, example code, browser support, and other helpful links.
- [Google Codelab Getting Started with Web Serial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/web-serial#0) - Easy to follow starter project for use with the BBC micro:bit.
- [web.dev tutorial](https://web.dev/serial/) - goes into detail about various aspects of the API, includes details about signals and streams.

## Demos

- [Custom controller and music game using Web Serial](https://github.com/louisfoster/paddle-game) - A kind of proof of concept of building a gaming system using just a few components, a microcontroller, and the Web Serial API (along with 2D canvas and Web Audio).
- [Web Serial API Example Project](https://github.com/louisfoster/serial-web-test) - A slightly more advanced "hello world" with a [live demo](https://louisfoster.github.io/serial-web-test/) (requires a serial device running the project's micropython code). Utilises 2 variable resistor values controlling 2 Web Audio API oscillators.

### Terminals

- [PWA serial terminal](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/serial-terminal) - Offline-capable serial terminal by Google Chrome Labs to demonstrate Web Serial API.
- [dead link] ~~[Windows XP -inspired web serial controller](https://webserial.app/) - Fun demonstration of a serial communication tool that resembles the UI of the Windows XP desktop.~~

## Applications

- [Kaluma IDE](https://kalumajs.org/ide/) - Browser-based IDE for a JavaScript runtime for the RP2040 that loads code onto the chip via Web Serial.
- [Piper MAKE](https://make.playpiper.com/) - Educational platform that uses a Blockly-like visual programming tool to write code and load it onto a Raspberry Pi Pico from the browser. Also, has a novel use of the File System Access API.
- [Adafruit ESP bootloader flashing tool](https://adafruit.github.io/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool/) - "WebSerial ESPTool designed to be a web-capable option for programming ESP32-S2 boards". There's also a [tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-metro-esp32-s2/web-serial-esptool) and [the code is available on Github](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_WebSerial_ESPTool).
- [Espruino IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/) - An entire web-based IDE for programming the Espruino range of boards. Includes built-in tutorials, guides, and the IDE even has auto-complete.
- [VitalSync](https://xchart.com/automatic-monitoring) - Reads vitals from monitors and produces charting report.
- [PN532.js](https://github.com/taichunmin/pn532.js) - A JavaScript library for PN532 base on Web Bluetooth and Web Serial.
- [Wavecake](https://app.getwavecake.com/webdevice) - An IDE for sandboxing Web Serial, Web Bluetooth and other scripts. Examples scripts are included. Also supports UI elements and charts.
- [Phomemo-M02-Web](https://github.com/K0IN/Phomemo-M02-Web) - A offline capable Progessive web app to print images using a Phomemo M02 printer.
